David Kranz is a Web Designer from Chicago Illinois that began
a new career in 2013. For more than 12 years he worked around
the CME and CBOT in the Chicago financial district and eventually
became a futures broker with a large firm. Instead of pursuing
work in a similar field, he decided to change his career to suit his
creative side and finish school doing something he loves and can
be proud of. He now has ZERO CREATIVITY and is of little to no use...

Thanks :)
